## High Priority
1. Make sound/particles last for 1s and fix eating particle positions
2. Check to make sure that the player dosen't already have a tamed wither when setting owner (use a mixin on PlayerEntity, and sync it to the wither's death)
3. Why does the wither get stuck trying to climb blocks during custom goals?

## Low Priority
1. Make WitherEatCookieGoal look at cookie
